# Karaimon Project
Hi. :)

## What is karaimon?
Karaimon is a little project to recreate Pokémon with Unity. It is purely educational and has no intention of commercial use.

## Who is doing it?
Me.

## Can I do it too?
Thx but no thx. Nothing personal, but this is a project so I can learn how to use the tool properly and evolve myself in the game development process.

## But this is not how Pokémon works!
Yeah, I know.
