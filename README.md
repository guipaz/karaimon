# Karaimon Project
Hi. :)

## What is Karaimon?
Karaimon is a little project to recreate Pokémon with Unity. It is purely educational and has no intention of commercial use.

## Who is doing it?
An obtuse chinchilla.

## Can I do it too?
Feel free to fork it and change it as much as you want.

## 'But this is not how Pokémon works'!
Yeah, we know. We'll work as much as possible to let it be just like the real deal in the end.

## This code is messy!
Yeah, we know. We intend to refactor everything as the project goes, but for now what matters is that it works. :)
